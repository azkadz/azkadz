Hello! I'm Azka (he/him) and I'm a first-year Engineering Science student at the University of Oxford! 📚 

I'm very interested in building my skills in data science and machine learning but also to develop further knowledge of data structures and algorithms! 👨‍💻 
I want to be able to use programming to develop engineering solutions in the real world. 🛠️ 
Currently studying C++, Python, MATLAB and I really want to get into React JS or HTML/CSS. 💭 

I would love to know more about the GitHub communities and hopefully enter into competitions which will contribute something to those communities! 🤝
